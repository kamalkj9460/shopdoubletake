We have some customers who carry the basics, but I want the option to throw in some extra, so they choose the London. That same person can easily fit their regular gear into the Melbourne, but on the days they carry more, it will just be packed tighter. We only recommend the Paris as a replacement for a regular tote bag - it has most of the bells and whistles of the other two bags in terms of organization, but it is a really small bag.
