We looked everywhere for it! Even the most expensive bags lacked the quiet ease-of-use and uncluttered design we were looking for. Since we couldn’t find it, we made one ourselves. In 2016, after three years of cutting and taping together prototypes of the ideal racquet bag, we achieved perfection—a bag that tennis and pickleball players are crazy about.<\/p>","text_style":"body"}},"165050347654a53809-2":{"type":"button","disabled":true,"settings":{"button_label":"Button label","button_link":""}}},"block_order":["165050347654a53809-0","165050347654a53809-1","165050347654a53809-2"],"settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/About-Doubletake-tennis-bags_14bd7cd4-4767-4cea-9266-857af2c445a6.jpg","height":"adapt","desktop_image_width":"medium","layout":"text_first","desktop_content_position":"top","desktop_content_alignment":"center","content_layout":"overlap","color_scheme":"background-1","mobile_content_alignment":"left","padding_top":16,"padding_bottom":0}},"165050476001cbc878":{"type":"multicolumn","blocks":{"1650504760dc769acc-0":{"type":"column","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Shawna_Krasts_CEO_Doubletake_6dd98c5f-4e7e-4f9e-82ae-7f64f063cc06.jpg","title":"Shawna Gwin Krasts","text":"<p>Co-Founder | CEO<\/p>","link_label":"","link":""}},"1650504760dc769acc-1":{"type":"column","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Dale_Breen_Chief_Designer_Doubletake.jpg","title":"Dale Breen","text":"<p>Co-Founder | Chief Designer<\/p>","link_label":"","link":""}},"1650504760dc769acc-2":{"type":"column","disabled":true,"settings":{"title":"Column","text":"<p>Pair text with an image to focus on your chosen product, collection, or blog post.
